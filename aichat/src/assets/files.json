      "context": "Angular is a comprehensive development platform built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes: A component-based framework for building scalable web applications, a collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more, and a suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code. Angular is used to build single-page applications (SPAs) and provides features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, templating, routing, and more. Key features include: Components for building UI widgets, Services for sharing code, Pipes for transforming data, Directives for extending HTML, and CLI tools for development. Angular uses TypeScript which adds optional static types to JavaScript. Angular's architecture is based on certain fundamental concepts: Components are the basic building blocks, Templates define the UI, Dependency injection provides services, and NgModules help organize code into cohesive blocks of functionality."

      "context": "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. Key features include: Static typing with type inference, Classes and interfaces for object-oriented programming, Generics for type-safe code reuse, Enums for better type safety, Decorators for metadata programming, and Advanced type features like union types and type guards. TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await. The TypeScript compiler performs type checking and transpilation to JavaScript. It can target different versions of JavaScript and supports module systems like CommonJS and ES Modules. TypeScript's type system helps catch errors early in development, improves code maintainability, and provides better tooling support with features like intelligent code completion and refactoring."

      "context": "Modern web development encompasses several key best practices for building efficient, maintainable, and secure applications. Performance optimization includes: Code splitting for faster initial load times, lazy loading of resources, efficient caching strategies, and minimizing bundle sizes. Security best practices include: Input validation, XSS prevention, CSRF protection, secure authentication methods, and proper error handling. Accessibility guidelines require: ARIA labels for screen readers, keyboard navigation support, proper color contrast, and semantic HTML structure. Responsive design principles include: Mobile-first approach, fluid layouts, responsive images, and CSS media queries. Testing strategies should cover: Unit testing of components, integration testing of features, end-to-end testing of workflows, and performance testing. Version control best practices include: Feature branching, meaningful commit messages, code review processes, and continuous integration. Code organization should follow: DRY principle, SOLID principles, proper documentation, and consistent coding standards."

      "name": "Frontend Architecture Patterns",
      "context": "Frontend architecture patterns are essential for building scalable and maintainable web applications. Common patterns include: MVC (Model-View-Controller) for separating data, presentation, and logic, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) popular in frameworks like Angular, Flux architecture used with React, and Redux for state management. Component-based architecture focuses on: Reusable UI components, proper component hierarchy, state management strategies, and component communication patterns. State management solutions include: Local component state, shared services, global stores like Redux or NgRx, and reactive programming with RxJS. Build and deployment architectures consider: Module bundling with tools like Webpack, environment configurations, deployment strategies, and CI/CD pipelines. Micro-frontend architecture allows: Independent deployment of frontend applications, team scalability, technology flexibility, and shared dependencies management. Performance patterns include: Virtual scrolling for large lists, tree-shaking for dead code elimination, and code splitting for optimized loading."
